# A-star-Algorithm-for-snake
This is a project i did for second year algorithms.
We had to make an AI for our snake to compete against other students, i ended up making the A* algorithm for pathfinding and some other basic logic for the game,
e.g to not go for the apple when it is bad as well as adding a helmet to the snakes head so he doesnt crash against other snakes going for the apple.
